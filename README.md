# Understanding Chat Data
Sharing my approach on how to perform an end-to-end transformation from Telegram Chat Data in HTML to visualised insights

## Exporting Telegram Chat Data
As long as you're using Telegram and are in a group chat/have an ongoing conversation with someone, you already have easy access to this data! You will need to have Telegram Desktop for the following steps:

1. Clicking into your chosen chat, look for the top right hand corner which provides a drop-down menu
2. Select option 'Export chat history'
3. Select appropriate Chat export settings -- it ranges from Photos, Video files, Stickers etc. but we are really going to only need the text messages
4. Click 'EXPORT' and you're done!
